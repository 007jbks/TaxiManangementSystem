## **1. Introduction**

### **1.1 Purpose**
This SRS document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the **Taxi Management System**.  
The system is designed as a Mini-DBMS project to demonstrate **Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD)** operations using **MySQL** and help manage taxis, drivers, bookings, and payments efficiently.

### **1.2 Scope**
The Taxi Management System will:
- Maintain records of taxis.
- Maintain driver details and assign taxis to drivers.
- Track driver daily expenses.
- Allow customers to book taxis.
- Manage payments and booking history.
- Provide an interface for admin/owner to monitor operations.

### **1.3 Definitions**
- **Taxi**: A vehicle available for rent.
- **Driver**: Person assigned to operate a taxi.
- **Booking**: A request by a customer to use a taxi.
- **Admin/Owner**: Person managing the system.
